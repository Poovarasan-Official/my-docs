# Nodejs

#### 1. What is Node.js?

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine. It is used to build scalable network applications.

##### key features of Node.js

- Asynchronous & Event-Driven: Uses non-blocking I/O operations.
- Single-Threaded: Uses a single thread with an event loop.
- Fast Execution: Built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.
- Scalability: Supports handling multiple connections efficiently.
- Cross-Platform: Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

##### advantages of using Node.js

- Fast execution speed (V8 engine).
- Non-blocking I/O operations (asynchronous).
- Single programming language (JavaScript) for full-stack development.
- Large community and extensive package support via npm

#### 2. What is the V8 engine, and how does Node.js use it?

Answer:
V8 is Google’s high-performance JavaScript engine used in Chrome. Node.js uses V8 to execute JavaScript code outside the browser.

#### 3. What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming?

`Synchronous`: Code executes line by line, blocking further execution.\
`Asynchronous`: Code runs without waiting for previous operations to complete.
