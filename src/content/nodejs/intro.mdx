# Nodejs

#### 1. What is Node.js?

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine. It is used to build scalable network applications.

##### key features of Node.js

- Asynchronous & Event-Driven: Uses non-blocking I/O operations.
- Single-Threaded: Uses a single thread with an event loop.
- Fast Execution: Built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.
- Scalability: Supports handling multiple connections efficiently.
- Cross-Platform: Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

##### advantages of using Node.js

- Fast execution speed (V8 engine).
- Non-blocking I/O operations (asynchronous).
- Single programming language (JavaScript) for full-stack development.
- Large community and extensive package support via npm

#### 2. What is the V8 engine, and how does Node.js use it?

Answer:
V8 is Google’s high-performance JavaScript engine used in Chrome. Node.js uses V8 to execute JavaScript code outside the browser.

#### 3. What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming?

`Synchronous`: Code executes line by line, blocking further execution.\
`Asynchronous`: Code runs without waiting for previous operations to complete.

#### 4. What is Middleware in Node.js?

Middleware functions in Node.js are functions that have access to the request (`req`), response (`res`), and the `next` function in the request-response cycle.

###### Types of Middleware

1. **Application-Level Middleware** (Like the logging middleware above)
2. **Router-Level Middleware** (Applied to specific routes using `express.Router()`)
3. **Built-in Middleware** (Like `express.json()` for parsing JSON)
4. **Error-Handling Middleware** (Handles errors using `err, req, res, next`)

```js filename="app.js" copy
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

// Middleware function
const loggerMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`Request Method: ${req.method}, Request URL: ${req.url}`);
  next(); // Pass control to the next middleware
};

// Apply middleware
app.use(loggerMiddleware);

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello, Middleware!");
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server running on http://localhost:3000");
});
```

#### 5. What is the difference between authentication and authorization?

**Answer:**

- **Authentication**: Verifies **who the user is** (identity verification).
- **Authorization**: Determines **what the user can do** (access control).

Authentication and Authorization are two crucial security concepts in web applications. Although they are related, they serve different purposes.

### **Key Differences**

| Feature            | Authentication                | Authorization                |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Definition**     | Verifies identity             | Determines permissions       |
| **Purpose**        | Confirms if a user is genuine | Controls access to resources |
| **When it occurs** | Before authorization          | After authentication         |
| **Example**        | Logging in with a password    | Accessing admin-only pages   |

### **Authentication**

Authentication verifies **who** the user is. It ensures that the person trying to access a system is who they claim to be.

**Example:**

- Logging into a website using a username and password.
- Using an OTP (One-Time Password) for identity verification.
- Signing in with Google or Facebook.

```js filename="authentication.js" copy
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.use(express.json());

// Dummy authentication middleware
const authenticateUser = (req, res, next) => {
  const { username, password } = req.body;

  if (username === "admin" && password === "password123") {
    console.log("User authenticated successfully!");
    next(); // Proceed to the next middleware or route
  } else {
    res.status(401).json({ message: "Authentication failed!" });
  }
};

app.post("/login", authenticateUser, (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: "Welcome, you are authenticated!" });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server running on http://localhost:3000");
});
```

#### 6. What are modules in Node.js? How do you create and use them?

Modules in Node.js are reusable pieces of code that can be imported and exported across different files. They help in structuring applications by breaking them into smaller, maintainable parts.

##### Node.js has three types of modules:

1. **Built-in Modules** - Predefined modules like `fs`, `http`, `path`.
2. **Custom Modules** - User-defined modules.
3. **Third-party Modules** - Installed via npm, like `express`, `mongoose`.

#### 1. Using Built-in Modules

Node.js provides many built-in modules like fs, path, and http. Example:

```js copy
const fs = require("fs");

// Writing to a file
fs.writeFileSync("example.txt", "Hello, Node.js!");
console.log("File created successfully.");
```

#### 2. Creating a Custom Module

create a module by exporting functions, objects, or variables from a separate file.

```js filename="math.js" copy
// Define a module with functions
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
const subtract = (a, b) => a - b;

// Export functions
module.exports = { add, subtract };
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Modules help in code reusability and maintainability.

- Custom Modules are created using module.exports and imported using require().
- Built-in Modules provide useful utilities.
- Third-party Modules extend functionality using npm.

#### 7. What are some core modules in Node.js?

Core modules in Node.js are built-in modules provided by Node.js that do not require installation. They help perform essential tasks like working with the filesystem, creating servers, handling streams, and more.

### **Common Core Modules in Node.js**

| Module     | Description                                              |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **fs**     | Handles file system operations (read/write files).       |
| **http**   | Creates HTTP servers and handles requests.               |
| **path**   | Works with file and directory paths.                     |
| **os**     | Provides system-related information.                     |
| **events** | Implements event-driven programming.                     |
| **util**   | Provides utilities for debugging and inspecting objects. |
| **crypto** | Handles encryption and security functions.               |

### **1. `fs` (File System) Module**

Used to read, write, and manage files.

```js filename="fs-example.js" copy
const fs = require("fs");

// Write to a file
fs.writeFileSync("example.txt", "Hello, Node.js!");
console.log("File created successfully.");

// Read from a file
const data = fs.readFileSync("example.txt", "utf8");
console.log("File Content:", data);
```

---

#### 8. What is the difference between require() and import?

In Node.js, both `require()` and `import` are used to load modules, but they have significant differences in how they work.

### **Key Differences**

| Feature               | `require()` (CommonJS)             | `import` (ES Modules)                     |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Module Type**       | CommonJS                           | ES Modules (ESM)                          |
| **Syntax**            | `const module = require('module')` | `import module from 'module'`             |
| **Execution**         | Synchronous (Blocking)             | Asynchronous (Non-blocking)               |
| **File Extension**    | `.js` (default in Node.js)         | `.mjs` or `.js` (with `"type": "module"`) |
| **Top-Level `await`** | ❌ Not supported                   | ✅ Supported                              |
| **Browser Support**   | ❌ No native browser support       | ✅ Works in modern browsers               |

Conclusion

- require() is used for CommonJS and works synchronously.
- import is used for ES Modules and supports asynchronous loading
- Node.js supports both, but ES Modules (import) is the future.

🚀 For modern projects, consider using ES Modules (import) for better performance and browser compatibility!

🚀 _Use `import` for modern applications to leverage ESM features!_

#### 9. Explain the event loop in Node.js. How does it work?

The **event loop** is a core mechanism in Node.js that allows it to handle non-blocking, asynchronous operations efficiently. It enables Node.js to perform I/O operations (reading files, network requests, database queries) without blocking the execution of other code.

Node.js uses **single-threaded, event-driven architecture** to handle multiple tasks asynchronously.

---

##### **How Does the Event Loop Work?**

The event loop consists of **six phases**, and it continuously cycles through them to execute tasks.

1. **Timers Phase** - Executes callbacks scheduled by `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()`.
2. **Pending Callbacks Phase** - Executes I/O callbacks deferred from previous operations.
3. **Idle/Prepare Phase** (Internal) - Used internally by Node.js, not relevant for developers.
4. **Poll Phase** - Retrieves new I/O events and executes related callbacks.
5. **Check Phase** - Executes callbacks from `setImmediate()`.
6. **Close Callbacks Phase** - Executes callbacks for closed resources (e.g., `socket.on('close', ...)`).

---

##### **Event Loop Flow**

1. Executes **synchronous code** (top-level code).
2. Processes **pending timers** (`setTimeout`, `setInterval`).
3. Executes **I/O tasks** (file reading, network requests).
4. Runs `setImmediate()` callbacks.
5. Executes **close events** (e.g., database connections).
6. Repeats the cycle.

---

##### **Example: Understanding the Event Loop**

```js filename="event-loop-example.js" copy
console.log("Start"); // Runs first

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Timeout Callback"); // Runs after poll phase
}, 0);

setImmediate(() => {
  console.log("Immediate Callback"); // Runs after the poll phase
});

Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log("Promise Callback")); // Runs before next event loop cycle

console.log("End"); // Runs second
```

---

#### 10. Explain the concept of streams in Node.js. What are the different types of streams?

Streams in Node.js are used to handle **large amounts of data** efficiently by reading or writing it **in chunks** instead of loading everything into memory at once. This improves **performance and scalability**, especially for I/O operations like file handling, network requests, and data processing.

Streams are **event-driven** and extend the `EventEmitter` class, allowing developers to listen for different stream-related events (`data`, `end`, `error`, etc.).

---

##### **Types of Streams in Node.js**

Node.js provides **four types of streams**:

| Type          | Description                                                                                          |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Readable**  | Used to read data (e.g., reading files, HTTP requests).                                              |
| **Writable**  | Used to write data (e.g., writing to a file, sending HTTP responses).                                |
| **Duplex**    | Can read and write simultaneously (e.g., sockets, network communications).                           |
| **Transform** | A special type of Duplex stream that modifies data while processing (e.g., compression, encryption). |

---

##### **1. Readable Stream (Reading Data)**

Used to **read data chunk by chunk** instead of loading it all at once.

##### **Example: Reading a File Stream**

```js filename="readable-stream.js" copy
const fs = require("fs");

const readableStream = fs.createReadStream("example.txt", { encoding: "utf8" });

readableStream.on("data", (chunk) => {
  console.log("Received chunk:", chunk);
});

readableStream.on("end", () => {
  console.log("Finished reading file.");
});
```

##### Why Use Streams?

✅ Efficient Memory Usage – Processes data in chunks, reducing memory consumption.\
✅ Faster Performance – No need to wait for the entire file to load.\
✅ Scalability – Handles large files and network data efficiently.

🚀 Streams are a powerful feature in Node.js, enabling efficient handling of large data flows in applications like file processing, APIs, and real-time data streaming!

#### 11. What are Buffers in Node.js?

A **Buffer** in Node.js is a **temporary storage area** for handling binary data. Buffers are mainly used when dealing with raw binary data, such as:

- **File system operations**
- **Networking (TCP streams, WebSockets)**
- **Data compression (zlib, gzip)**
- **Cryptography**

Since **JavaScript (JS) strings are UTF-16 encoded**, Buffers provide a way to handle raw binary data efficiently.

---

##### **Creating a Buffer**

##### **1. Allocating a New Buffer**

```js filename="buffer-alloc.js" copy
const buffer = Buffer.alloc(10); // Creates a buffer of 10 bytes
console.log(buffer); // <Buffer 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00>
```

#### 12. What is the role of the `Buffer` class in Node.js?

#### 13. Explain the difference between `process.nextTick()` and `setImmediate()` in Node.js.

#### 14. What is the difference between `spawn`, `exec`, and `fork` in the child_process module?

#### 15. What is the difference between session-based and token-based authentication?

##### **Key Differences Between Session-Based and Token-Based Authentication**

| Feature                    | Session-Based Authentication                                               | Token-Based Authentication                                                                           |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Storage**                | Stored on the **server** (memory/database)                                 | Stored on the **client** (localStorage, cookies, or headers)                                         |
| **Scalability**            | Less scalable (server must manage sessions)                                | Highly scalable (stateless, works well with microservices & APIs)                                    |
| **Security**               | Vulnerable to **session hijacking** & **CSRF** attacks                     | Vulnerable to **token theft** if not stored securely                                                 |
| **Performance**            | Server load increases with more users                                      | Faster as the server does not store session data                                                     |
| **Authentication Process** | User logs in → Server creates a session → Sends a session ID to the client | User logs in → Server issues a **JWT** (JSON Web Token) → Client stores & sends it with each request |
| **Data Validation**        | Session ID is validated by the server                                      | JWT is **self-contained** and verified using a secret key                                            |
| **State Management**       | **Stateful** (server maintains user session)                               | **Stateless** (no need to track sessions on the server)                                              |
| **Usage**                  | Best for traditional web apps requiring frequent authentication            | Best for APIs, mobile apps, and distributed systems                                                  |

#### 16. What are JWT tokens, and how are they used in Node.js??

#### 17. What is `helmet`, and why should it be used in Express.js?

[`helmet`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/helmet) is a **security middleware** for **Express.js** that helps protect web applications by setting various HTTP headers. It prevents common security vulnerabilities such as **cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking, MIME sniffing, and more**.

### Why Use `helmet` in Express.js?

✅ Prevents Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\
✅ Protects Against Clickjacking Attacks\
✅ Disables Browser Sniffing\
✅ Adds Security Headers Automatically\

#### 19. How to optimize a Node.js application for performance?

#### 20. What is the difference between PM2 and Nodemon?

`PM2` and `Nodemon` are both tools used to manage Node.js applications, but they serve different purposes.

### **Key Differences Between PM2 and Nodemon**

| Feature                  | PM2                                                            | Nodemon                                                       |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**              | Process manager for production environments.                   | Automatically restarts Node.js apps during development.       |
| **Use Case**             | Best for running and managing apps in production.              | Best for development to auto-restart on file changes.         |
| **Automatic Restart**    | Restarts crashed apps automatically.                           | Restarts the app only when file changes are detected.         |
| **Clustering Support**   | Supports multi-instance clustering for performance.            | Does not support clustering.                                  |
| **Logging & Monitoring** | Provides built-in logging, monitoring, and process management. | No advanced logging or monitoring.                            |
| **Daemon Mode**          | Runs apps in the background (as a service).                    | Runs in the foreground and stops when the terminal is closed. |
| **Load Balancing**       | Supports load balancing across CPU cores.                      | Does not support load balancing.                              |
| **Installation Command** | `npm install -g pm2`                                           | `npm install -g nodemon`                                      |

---

##### When to Use PM2?

✅ For running Node.js applications in production\
✅ If you need auto-restart on crashes\
✅ When load balancing & clustering are required\
✅ If you need logs, monitoring, and process management

##### Example: Running a Node.js App with PM2

```bash filename="terminal" copy
pm2 start app.js --name "my-app"
pm2 list  # View running processes
pm2 logs  # Check logs
pm2 stop my-app  # Stop the app
```

#### 21. What is the purpose of the package.json file?
