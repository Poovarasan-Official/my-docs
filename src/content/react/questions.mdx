# React.js Interview Questions and Answers

This guide covers essential **React.js** interview questions from **basic to advanced**, including **hooks theory with examples**.

## 1. What is React?

**Answer:**
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, maintained by Facebook. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage state efficiently using a virtual DOM.

## 2. What is the Virtual DOM?

**Answer:**
The Virtual DOM is a `lightweight JavaScript` representation of the `actual DOM.` React updates this virtual DOM before syncing it with the real DOM, improving performance.

## 3. What is JSX?

**Answer:**
JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows writing HTML within React code.

**Example:**

```jsx filename="JSXExample.js" copy
const element = <h1>Hello, JSX!</h1>;
```

## 4. What is a Fragment in React?

**Answer:**
A **Fragment** in React allows `grouping multiple elements` without adding an extra node to the **DOM**. It helps avoid unnecessary `<div>` wrappers, which can bloat the structure of the rendered HTML.

### Example:

```jsx filename="FragmentExample.js"{5,8} copy
import React, { Fragment } from "react";

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Fragment>
      <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
      <p>This is a React Fragment example.</p>
    </Fragment>
  );
}
export default MyComponent;
```

Alternatively, you can use the shorthand syntax:

```jsx filename="ShortFragmentExample.js"{3,6} copy
function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
      <p>This is a React Fragment example.</p>
    </>
  );
}
export default MyComponent;
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> Using **Fragments** helps improve performance and maintain a cleaner **DOM structure**.

## 5. What is a Component in React?

**Answer:**
A component in React is a **reusable**, **self-contained** piece of UI that can be rendered independently. Components allow for code reuse and better organization. They accept **inputs called props** and return **React elements** that describe how a section of the UI should appear. Components can be categorized into:

- **Functional Components**: These are JavaScript functions that accept props and return JSX. They rely on React Hooks for state and lifecycle methods.
  Do not have state or lifecycle methods but can use **React Hooks** (`useState`, `useEffect`, etc.) to manage state and lifecycle behavior.
  Easier to read, test, and maintain.

- **Class Components**: These are ES6 classes that extend `React.Component` and include lifecycle methods and state management.
  Class components is a javascript class that extends to React.Component & uses a render method to return JSX. And have a managing state and lifecycle methods like componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate.

### Example:

```jsx filename="Greeting.js"{1} copy
function Greeting(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}
export default Greeting;
```

```jsx filename="GreetingClass.js"{3-4} copy
import React, { Component } from "react";

class Greeting extends Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;
  }
}
export default Greeting;
```

## 6. What are React Hooks?

**Answer:**
React Hooks are functions that allow functional components to use **state** and **lifecycle features** without needing class components.

> [!CAUTION]
>
> ##### Rules of Hooks:
>
> - **Only call hooks at the top level**: Don't call hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.
> - **Only call hooks from React functions**: Hooks should be used in functional components or custom hooks.

#### Common Hooks:

1. `useState` - Manages local state.
2. `useEffect` - Handles side effects.
3. `useContext` - Uses React Context API.
4. `useCallback` - Memoizes functions.
5. `useReducer` - Alternative to `useState` for complex state logic.
6. `useMemo` - Optimizes performance by memoizing values.
7. `useRef` - Creates a reference to DOM elements.

## 7. What are Props?

Props (short for **properties**) are used to pass data from a **parent component** to a **child component** in React. They are **read-only** and help make components **reusable and dynamic**.

#### Key Features of Props

âœ… **Allows data flow from parent to child**\
âœ… **Immutable (cannot be changed by the child component)**\
âœ… **Helps create reusable components**

## Syntax

```jsx
<MyComponent propName="value" />
```

### Example: Passing Props in React

#### 1. Parent Component

```jsx filename="App.js" copy
import React from "react";
import Greeting from "./Greeting";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Greeting name="Alice" />
      <Greeting name="Bob" />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

#### 2. Child Component (Receiving Props)

```jsx filename="Greeting.js" copy
import React from "react";

function Greeting({ name }) {
  return <h2>Hello, {name}!</h2>;
}

export default Greeting;
```

#### Explanation

- `App.js` passes a **name** prop (`Alice` & `Bob`) to the `Greeting` component.
- `Greeting.js` receives the prop and displays it dynamically.
- The child component cannot modify the prop; it is **read-only**.

#### Using Default Props

You can set default values for props in case they are not provided.

```jsx
Greeting.defaultProps = {
  name: "Guest",
};
```

## Summary

âœ… **Props allow components to communicate**.\
âœ… **They are immutable** and should not be modified within the child component.\
âœ… **Essential for reusable and modular components**.

Props help build dynamic UI elements and enhance component reusability! ðŸš€

## 8. What is Prop Drilling?

**Answer:**
Prop drilling is when data is passed through multiple components that don't directly need it, leading to unnecessary complexity.

## 9. What is the `key` Prop?

The `key` prop is a special attribute in React that helps efficiently update and render lists of components. It provides a unique identity to each element, allowing React to track changes and optimize re-rendering.

#### Why is `key` Important?

- **Efficient Rendering:** Helps React identify which items changed, added, or removed.
- **Prevents Unnecessary Re-Renders:** Avoids re-creating entire lists unnecessarily.
- **Improves Performance:** Helps in maintaining component state across re-renders.

#### Example: Using `key` in a List

```jsx filename="KeyExample.js" copy
import React from "react";

const ItemList = ({ items }) => {
  return (
    <ul>
      {items.map((item) => (
        <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
};

export default ItemList;
```

#### Best Practices for `key`

âœ… Use **unique IDs** whenever possible (`key={item.id}`).\
âœ… If no ID is available, use **stable indexes**, but avoid if items can be reordered (`key={index}`).\
âœ… Never use **random values** as keys (e.g., `Math.random()`), as it negates Reactâ€™s optimizations.

#### Key Takeaways

âœ… Essential for **efficient re-renders** in dynamic lists.\
âœ… Helps React **track elements** in lists when they change.\
âœ… Always use **stable, unique values** to ensure proper UI updates.

## 10. What are Controlled and Uncontrolled Components?

In React, form inputs can be controlled or uncontrolled depending on how their state is managed.

#### When to Use Each?

- **Use Controlled Components** for forms that require real-time validation, conditional rendering, or integration with React state.
- **Use Uncontrolled Components** when working with non-React code, simple inputs, or when performance optimization is necessary.

#### Key Differences

| Feature          | Controlled Components                              | Uncontrolled Components                          |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **State**        | Managed by React state                             | Managed by the DOM                               |
| **Data Flow**    | React state is the source of truth                 | DOM is the source of truth                       |
| **Value Update** | Via Reactâ€™s `useState` or `setState`               | Access via refs or reading DOM values            |
| **Use Case**     | Complex forms, validation, real-time input changes | Simple forms, minimal interaction with form data |

### Example of a Controlled Component

```jsx filename="ControlledComponent.js" copy
import React, { useState } from "react";

function ControlledComponent() {
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState("");

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={inputValue}
        onChange={(e) => setInputValue(e.target.value)}
      />
      <p>Typed Value: {inputValue}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default ControlledComponent;
```

### Example of an Uncontrolled Component

```jsx filename="UncontrolledComponent.js" copy
import React, { useRef } from "react";

function UncontrolledComponent() {
  const inputRef = useRef(null);

  const handleSubmit = () => {
    alert(`Entered Value: ${inputRef.current.value}`);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input type="text" ref={inputRef} />
      <button onClick={handleSubmit}>Submit</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default UncontrolledComponent;
```

## Conclusion

Both approaches have their use cases, but controlled components offer more control and are more commonly used in complex React applications.

## 11. What is Lazy Loading?

Lazy loading is a technique in React that allows components to be loaded only when needed, improving performance and reducing the initial bundle size.

#### Why Use Lazy Loading?

- ðŸš€ **Improves Performance**: Loads only the required components when needed.
- ðŸ“¦ **Reduces Initial Bundle Size**: Helps in faster page loads.
- âš¡ **Efficient Resource Utilization**: Saves bandwidth by avoiding unnecessary code execution.

#### Implementing Lazy Loading in React

React provides `React.lazy` and `Suspense` for implementing lazy loading.

#### Example: Lazy Loading a Component

```jsx filename="App.js" copy
import React, { Suspense, lazy } from "react";

// Lazy loading the component
const LazyComponent = lazy(() => import("./LazyComponent"));

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to Lazy Loading Example</h1>
      <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading...</p>}>
        <LazyComponent />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

#### Example: Lazy Loaded Component

```jsx filename="LazyComponent.js" copy
import React from "react";

function LazyComponent() {
  return <h2>This is a lazily loaded component!</h2>;
}

export default LazyComponent;
```

#### Key Takeaways

âœ… **Better Performance**: Reduces unnecessary rendering.\
âœ… **Code Splitting**: Helps in optimizing large applications.\
âœ… **Dynamic Imports**: Loads components only when required.

Lazy loading is essential for optimizing React applications, especially when dealing with large codebases! ðŸš€

## 12. What is a Higher-Order Component (HOC)?

A **Higher-Order Component (HOC)** is a pattern in React that allows reusing component logic by wrapping a component inside another function. It takes a component as input and returns a new enhanced component.

HOCs are **pure functions** that do not modify the original component but return a new component with added functionalities.

#### Why Use HOCs?

- Code reusability and logic abstraction.
- Enhancing components with additional props.
- Useful for authentication, logging, and performance optimizations.

## Example of a Higher-Order Component

### Creating a HOC for Authorization

```jsx copy
import React from "react";

// Higher-Order Component
const withAuth = (WrappedComponent) => {
  return class extends React.Component {
    componentDidMount() {
      const isAuthenticated = localStorage.getItem("authToken");
      if (!isAuthenticated) {
        alert("You need to log in first!");
      }
    }

    render() {
      return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} />;
    }
  };
};

// Regular Component
const Dashboard = () => {
  return <h1>Welcome to Dashboard</h1>;
};

// Wrapped with HOC
const ProtectedDashboard = withAuth(Dashboard);

export default ProtectedDashboard;
```

#### Common Use Cases for HOCs

- **Authentication Handling** (Restrict access to pages)
- **Logging & Analytics** (Track user actions)
- **Enhancing Props** (Modify or inject props into components)
- **Code Splitting** (Lazy loading components)

#### Key Points

- HOCs should **not modify the original component**, but return a new one.
- Naming convention: `withSomething` (e.g., `withAuth`, `withLogging`).
- Use HOCs wisely; sometimes React Hooks (`useEffect`, `useContext`) are better alternatives.

HOCs are a powerful pattern but should be used when necessary to keep the codebase clean and maintainable. ðŸš€
