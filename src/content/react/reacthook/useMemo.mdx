## What is `useMemo` in React?

**Answer:**
`useMemo` is a React Hook that **optimizes performance** by **memoizing computed values** to prevent unnecessary recalculations. It helps avoid expensive operations on every render.

### **Key Features:**

- **Caches expensive calculations** and only recalculates when dependencies change.
- **Improves performance** by avoiding unnecessary re-computations.
- **Useful when dealing with heavy computations or derived state.**

### **Example:**

```jsx filename="UseMemoExample.js" copy
import React, { useState, useMemo } from "react";

function ExpensiveCalculationComponent({ num }) {
  const squaredNumber = useMemo(() => {
    console.log("Calculating Square...");
    return num * num;
  }, [num]);

  return <p>Squared Number: {squaredNumber}</p>;
}

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [num, setNum] = useState(5);

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Count: {count}</h2>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment Count</button>
      <ExpensiveCalculationComponent num={num} />
      <button onClick={() => setNum(num + 1)}>Increase Number</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### **Why Use `useMemo`?**

✅ **Prevents expensive calculations** from running on every render.
✅ **Improves performance** in cases of heavy computations.
✅ **Works well when derived state depends on expensive operations.**
